								<h2>Bilal<br>Khan</h2>
								<p>I’m a BS(CS) Graduate, Data Enthusiast and a Software Engineer</p>

							<p class="mb-5">
								You ask me if this man can promise you a time of science, solutions, and adventure? 
								Aye! I am a dedicated volunteer, optimist, a rational thinker and always looking to learn more and new. 
								My interest are creating data centric applications, Software Engineering, Data Engineering and Sciences. 
								My expertise lies in teaching machines, working with SQL and many of its flavors, creating data pipelines, 
								Python and its multiple elegant frameworks, Vue.js for making stunning frontend designs and turning data into information.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-5">
								I've worked extensively on <strong>time series analysis</strong> and presentation including 2 publications. 
								Working on web apps with Python and it's frameworks is what I love. 
								Documenting my work is one of my forte. 
								I'm renowned for making unique or rather intriguing projects throughout. 
								Please do check out my <strong><a class="no-highlight-link" href="https://github.com/Bill-Klay" target="_blank">GitHub</a></strong>.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-5">
								My goal is to work in an organization to implement the skills I have achieved throughout my career, 
								may it not be just what I learned as a student or a professional, 
								but soft skills gained through experience and meeting great people like you! 
								<strong>Independent and stoic</strong> are the kind of words that best describe me. 
								I like making my own decisions, a great team leader not only representing myself but his fellows and organization. 
								A coder by heart and speaker by the mind.
							</p>
							<p class="mb-5">
								As a person outside of work I like to build myself and my personality, 
								read on innovation and technology, break and repair my <strong>Linux</strong>, make 'good' jokes and write quotes; 
								maybe check out my little secret notebook? I'm a canny one, 
								know my way around <strong>scripting</strong> and coding and love to talk nerd. 
								A nice guy who doesn't finish last, as I like to call it, <i>"professionals have standards,
								but we're human beings before being professional".</i> 
								So, if its fortune and adventure you seek then <strong>Bilal Khan</strong> is your man, 
								for there's more mystery to that man that even I myself dare ask.

									<h3>Compliance Monitoring</h3>
									<p>
										The business of the product lies in processing compliance
										spend reports and clustering, assigning and generating
										risk scores for each speaker/event. The product is heavily
										dependent upon dynamic T-SQL queries, Fisher Jenks
										algorithm using Python and SSIS ETL packages. A monitoring
										logs screen was also created for CM as a dev screen using
										flask as the backend and Vue.js for frontend. I’m currently
										assigned as one of the core developer for CM. A product that
										analyzes speaker and event spendings
										for Pharma companies and generates
										risk score based on the set of logics
										defined in the Risk Engine which works
										on the underlying principles of
										multiple Stats models including
										classifying the severity. CM follows an
										OLAP architecture with high
										dynamicity in mind, adjustable weights
										and algorithms. Current features being
										worked on include data mappings with
										NLP and OCR for invoice scanning.

									<h3>Jira Connector</h3>
									<p>
										This project was made as an inhouse improvement
										for making a publicly viewed dashboard that shows
										team engagements and what is being curated inside
										the production environment. It uses Python as the base
										environment making use of the plotly dash framework
										for hosting plotly enabled dashboards.
										The dashboard provides users with acces to donwloading
										all the tickets or specified tickets from Jira Cloud
										based on the entered JQL. The dashboards presents with
										an interactive data table for viewing the results from
										the JQL, plus a summary of the Estimates and Utilization
										of the work logged. An overall graphs shows all the users
										with there estimates and utilization in a bar graph with
										more graphs and individual person view available from the
										drop down. A teamwise segregation is also availabe at the
										end for which there first needs to be an excel present with
										all the team members name and there department.

									<h3> Skincare Recommendation Android Application </h3>
									<p>
										This app uses dataset from Kaggle and
										scrapped data from cosmetics
										websites to work a Tf-IDF vectorizer
										for content based filtering, and KNN
										and Decision trees for collaborative
										based filtering. The notebook also
										contains other approaches for POC
										including SVD. Backend APIs are based
										on Flask, Android application is made
										using Java with Android Studio
										whereas Firebase acts as the database
										and the middleware for relaying login
										information as well to serve the data
										to the application. Deployed onto
										Heroku with Firebase as the serverless
										backend.
